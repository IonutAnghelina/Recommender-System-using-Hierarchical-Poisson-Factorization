# Recommender-System-using-Hierarchical-Poisson-Factorization

This repository contains all code used during the Probabilistic Programming Project on Building a Recommender System inspired by the Hierarchical Poisson Factorization Algorithm.

The dataset on which the project was evaluated can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

For efficiency purposes, only a subset of this dataset was used for evaluation, namely full_dataset.csv, whereas the sanity_check.csv subset was used for intermediary checks and Hyperparameter Tuning.

The project also tackles the Regression Task on estimating the Rating a user would set for a certain movie.

All information on the approaches used, experiments and metrics can be found in the Probabilistic Programming.pdf file.

Codes for the two approaches can be found at:

+ Binary_HPF - for the classification task
+ Regression_HPF - for the regression task
